Some fine tuning for the full HD skins

Git 59   21-01-2015 (Openpli 20+git17)
A first step to make the BackupSuite also useable on full HD format skins (1920*1080). 
There still has to be done some work but because of the experimental stage of the full HD skin this has, for me, a low priority at the moment.

- Removed the image of the fireworks

Git 55   01-01-2015 (Openpli 20+git13)
- Russian translation improved (thanks to 2boom)
- Simplified the messages, no receiver specific instructions anymore on how to restore the image, 
  just "Please check the manual of the receiver on how to restore the image."
- Deleted the messages column in the lookuptable.txt because of above mentioned simplification.

Git 54   27-12-2014 (Openpli 20+git12)

Git 50-53   22-12-2014 (Openpli 20+git11)
- Corrected lookuptable.txt for the entry Vu+ Solo SE, used a wrong name for root_cfe_auto.bin
- Added instructions to restore a backup for the Vu+ Solo SE and Vu+ Zero. 
  These directions are only in English and Dutch at the moment.
- Cleaned the message-file, removed some obsolete messages. The language files however needs some attention.
- Corrected some parameters for the Vu+ Zero and Vu+ Solo SE

git 47   21-12-2014 
- Made a workaround to create a postrm if it doesn't exist to ensure a clean uninstall.

git 45   12-12-2014 (Openpli 20+git6)
- Added a seasonal picture :-)

git 43 & 44   02-12-2014 (Openpli 20+git5)
- Changed keymapping to EPGSelectAction

git 42   01-12-2014 (Openpli 20+git4)
- Because of some changes in Openpli I had to change the mapping of the guide/info key. It should work on updated and non-updated receivers (Thanks Dima73 for the hint)

git 41   30-11-2014 (Openpli 20+git3)
- If stored speed in speed.txt = 0 then use the default speed of 250 to avoid a divide by zero error.
